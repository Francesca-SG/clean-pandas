# Data Analysis Project


## Introduction
This is a data analysis project I am currently working on to learn more about Python, pandas, and data analysis, particularly cleaning and preprocessing data. So far I have learned that Pandas is a powerful tool that can be used to analyse and clean large datasets.

## Project Description

In this project, I worked with a dataset of INC 5000 companies. I cleaned part of the data, handled missing values, renamed columns, and performed some basic analysis. I am still in the process of cleaning this data.
My intentions moving forward are to move the cleaned data to excel to practice some visualisation techniques. I would also like to get this data into SQL so I can strengthen and expand my knowledge of inserting, manipulating and removing data.

My hopes for this project are to improve my skills in Python, Pandas, SQL and visualisation tools like Power BI, Tableau and to get a deeper understanding of the processes of data analysis. 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Renaming columns
- Checking for outliers
- Basic data analysis
- Clean and organised code


## Results and Insights
There was a lot of missing data in the 'metro' column. I was unsure how to handle this. After seeing that the column could provide valuable insights into trends in larger city areas I decided to fill the null values with N/A. 
I had an issue where I kept on commenting out my code assuming the changes to the csv file had been saved without using inplace. I still have a lot to learn but I am enjoying the process.

The revenue column is a string data type instead of a float. The text need to be removed, converted to a float and multiplied to get the accurate values. 


## Viewing the Project

You can view the Python code for this project in the `INC5000DataAnalysis.py` file. The `INC5000_Companies_2019.csv` file contains the original dataset I worked with.
